# Introduction to Supervised Learning

This repository contains slides and an interactive notebook on supervised learning. In the slides the reader learns about what neural networks are, and how they work. In the notebook is a Python tutorial where the reader builds a supervised learning network to classify stars, galaxies and quasars from SDSS spectra.

The material includes:

- A conceptual overview of supervised learning and neural networks
- A hands-on Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/sdss_tutorial.ipynb`)
- Sample SDSS spectra stored under `data/`

## Getting Started

If you already have Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter installed on your system, setup is simple:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rosenberg9/Intro-to-Supervised-Learning.git
cd Intro-to-Supervised-Learning
