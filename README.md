# Introduction to Supervised Learning

This repository contains slides and an interactive notebook on supervised learning. In the slides the reader learns about what neural networks are, and how they work. In the notebook is a Python tutorial where the reader builds a supervised learning network to classify stars, galaxies and quasars from SDSS spectra.
